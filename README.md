# Project Codename Shootmans

A small game, potentially an arena style first person shooter, made with the Bevy game engine, intended to be played with mates at a LAN.

# Build

Should be as simple a the good old `cargo build`, but if that doesn't work, follow the [bevy quickstart](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/)
